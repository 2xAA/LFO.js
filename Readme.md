#LFO JS

This project is a little and simple JavaScript library that will implement LFOs in JavaScript.

##What is an LFO

LFO stands for Low Frequency Oscillator. It's basically just a device which oscillates between two values on a certain frequency and following a given waveform.

##TODO

- Clean up the code
- Throw the LFO class in a separate file
- Make an ES6 module (that's going to be fun)
- Document
